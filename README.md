# An application on the Cesar algorithm using the Python programming language

This project aims to train on how to design encryption algorithms using the Python programming language, and at the same time, it seeks to teach how to create easy and simple user interfaces in the Python language.

By running the code or by opening the caesar.exe file located in the dist folder, you can see the user interface how it works in a simple way. You must first specify the encryption key, which is a number that expresses the amount of displacement, and then you can encrypt or decrypt the text. .
